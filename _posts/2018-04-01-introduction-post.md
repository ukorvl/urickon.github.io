## What is =nil; Foundation?

[=nil; Foundation](https://nil.foundation) is a non-profit organization
established in April of 2018 to facilitate cryptography and databases research 
and development.

## =nil; Foundation Initiatives

Foundation supports projects which are established by the Foundation itself and
ones established by third-parties as well.

Initial set of projects supported by the Foundation contains:
* [=nil; Crypto3 Cryptography Suite](https://crypto3.nil.foundation/projects/crypto3) 
created by Foundation's [=nil; Crypto3](https://crypto3.nil.foundation) cryptography 
team
* [=nil; Database Management System](https://dbms.nil.foundation) created
by Foundation's [=nil; Database](https://database.nil.foundation) team.

### =nil; Crypto3 Cryptography Suite

Cryptography suite project was established to provide architecturally elegant
and efficient modern cryptography primitives implementation along with more
tranditional constructions implemented in the same way. Crypto3 suite eventually 
became the foundation for all cryptography research and development within the
Foundation, reducing security risks of misimplementation or a design flaw.

## =nil; Foundation Teams

Being an R&D non-profit means to have associated teams to carry the expertise and
perform the actual research. That is why [=nil; Foundation](https://nil.foundation) 
has several associated teams which help to facilitate the results.

### =nil; Crypto3 Team

To handle all the R&D happening around =nil; Crypto3 Cryptography Suite, a
cryptography-dedicated [=nil; Crypto3](https://crypto3.nil.foundation) team was 
established. It's interests vary from applied compexity-theory research and 
cryptography schemes constructions and implementations development to
cryptography and protocol security audits. More on that can be noticed at
https://crypto3.nil.foundation/
